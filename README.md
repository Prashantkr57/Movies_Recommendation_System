# Technologies used:
1. Python - To build the Machine Learning model.
2. Jupyter Notebook (You can use any other IDE like Google Colab) - To train the model.
3. Streamlit Framework - To create Web Application for our model.
4. Heroku - To deploy our model.

# Python libraries Used:
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. SciKit Learn
4. Streamlit
5. Requests
6. Pickle

# Tools Needed to build this Web Application:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Pycharm (Any other IDE can work)
3. Any Browser

# Steps to Run this in your local system:
1. Dowload the Datasets
2. Copy and paste the Jupyter Notebook ipynb code in a New Notebook in your system
3. Generate the pickle file
4. Create a python project in Pycharm (or any Python IDE)
5. Import the pickle file in that project
6. Use the Streamlit code template to build the web application
